# Introduction to Bash Scripting

Bash scripting is a powerful skill that allows you to automate tasks and perform various operations on the command line. This repository serves as a beginner's guide to Bash scripting using a simple "Hello, World!" script as an example.

## What is Bash?

Bash, short for **Bourne-Again SHell**, is a Unix shell and command language interpreter. It provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system and running various commands, programs, and scripts. Bash scripting involves writing a series of commands in a plain text file, which can then be executed as a script.

## Getting Started

1. **Installing Bash:** Before you can start writing and running Bash scripts, make sure you have Bash installed on your system. You can check if Bash is installed by opening a terminal and running the command: `bash --version`.

2. **Cloning the Repository:** To get started with the example script, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


3. **Navigating to the Directory:** Change your working directory to the repository folder:


## Understanding the Example Script

The provided script, `hello_world.sh`, is a basic example of a Bash script. It does one simple task: printing "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

Here's a breakdown of the script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"

#!/bin/bash: This is called a shebang or hashbang. It indicates the interpreter (in this case, Bash) that should be used to execute the script.

echo "Hello, World!": The echo command is used to display text on the terminal. In this case, it outputs the string "Hello, World!".
