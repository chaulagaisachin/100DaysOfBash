## Explanation of the code:

1. `#!/bin/bash`: This line indicates that the script should be interpreted using the Bash shell.

2. `echo -n "Enter a number: "`: This command displays the text "Enter a number: " without a newline character, prompting the user to enter a number.

3. `read number`: This command reads the input entered by the user and stores it in the variable `number`.

4. `if (( number % 2 == 0 )); then`: This line starts an `if` statement that checks whether the remainder of `number` divided by 2 is equal to 0, which indicates an even number.

5. `echo "$number is even."`: If the condition in the `if` statement is true (the number is even), this command prints a message indicating that the number is even.

6. `else`: If the condition in the `if` statement is false (the number is odd), the script executes the code following the `else` keyword.

7. `echo "$number is odd."`: This command prints a message indicating that the number is odd.

8. `fi`: This marks the end of the `if` statement.

To use this script, save it in a `.sh` file (e.g., `even_odd_checker.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x even_odd_checker.sh`, and run it using `./even_odd_checker.sh` in the terminal. It will prompt you to enter a number and then display whether the number is even or odd based on the condition.
